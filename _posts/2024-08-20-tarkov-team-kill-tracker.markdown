I want to learn ðŸ¦€RustðŸ¦€, and for that I decided to do a fun project.

I confess I really like the game [Escape From Tarkov](https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/), for the ones don't know, it's a shooter-looter quite challenging.

Here you can find a video of me, killing one of the most difficult bosses in the game, [Killa](https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Killa):

When you play with friends, there is no way to identify who is your teammate (apart from asking questions like: `is that you?`, `are you in <insert place>?`).

For that reason, it's quite common to have [team kills](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/teamkill). ðŸ‘€

# ðŸ’¡Idea
I thought it could be a good idea to create a [Discord bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) to keep track of the team-kills that happens. To make it a bit more fun it could have achievements. I came up with some of them, as an example:

+ ðŸŽ‰First team kill registeredðŸŽ‰
+ ðŸ‘ºKilled by five different friendsðŸ‘º
...

+ Also, to promote people using this bot, I thought it could be nice if the `"killer"` get roasted by that team-kill. So then, once the team kill is registered, ChatGPT would reply to the command by roasting the player that made the team-kill.

# ðŸ‘·Implementation

The flow is the following:
+ User registers who team-killed him using a discord command: `> /tk @Manuelarte`
+ App registers the team kill and
+ Checks for achievements
+ Requests to ChatGPT a Roast to the user.
+ Replies the message to the author plus the achievements achieved with that team-kill.
