One thing about being a developer, is how frustrating the job search process can be. One of the things I encountered was the request for recommendations from other colleagues.

I am lately quite active in GitHub, I created some small libraries, and I also contributed to others, so, in case any recruiter checks my GitHub profile (most recruiters don't do), they can see my repositories, but thereâ€™s no straightforward way to showcase who youâ€™ve worked with or who recommends working with you.

# App GitHub Kudos
GitHub lacks a simple, personalized way to share personalized shoutouts, so I decided to build a solution: GitHub Kudos.

GitHub Kudos is an app that generates an image featuring a GitHub user's avatar with their recommendation. My intention is that these images can be displayed in GitHub profiles and/or personal websites to share how other developers recommend you (or who you recommend).

If you want to see how it looks, you can check [my profile](https://github.com/manuelarte#-people-i-recommend)

Or if you want to see how the image looks by itself [link](https://github-kudos.com/manuelarte/kudos/octocat)

I donâ€™t think this will completely eliminate recruiters asking for recommendations, but I hope it makes it easier to share and showcase them. ðŸ˜Š

# How Does It Work

The app is quite simple, let's say Alice (GitHub login alice) wants to recommend Bob (GitHub username bob), then these are the steps:

+ Alice creates a repository called github-kudos (alice/github-kudos).
+ Alice creates a file bob.md in which she writes her recommendation to Bob.
+ Either Alice or Bob can access the kudos image by https://github-kudos.com/alice/kudos/bob
+ (I created a [template repository](https://github.com/manuelarte/github-kudos-template) in GitHub to facilitate this setup)
